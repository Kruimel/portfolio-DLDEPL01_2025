## Hypothesis

I am interesed in the effect of the following parameters of a convolutional network for image classification of different sizes.

- kernel size
- number of kernels
- the use of padding
- different methods op pooling; max pooling, mean pooling or downsampling

I think larger images need a bigger kernel size and higher number of kernels to capture its complexity. I also expect not using padding has more influence on training a model for smaller images than it is for larger images because you lose a larger proportion of the data. Finally, I suspect that the pooling method should not make a different as they all make a summary of the features.
