# Ethical model comparison

One of the definitions of the word "ethics" given by the Oxford Dictionaries goes as follows: "the moral principles that govern a person's or group's behaviour". Ethical models are therefor designed to guide professionals in decision-making. There are many models available, of which quite a few are compared in Johnson at al.'s (2021). Here we compare two of those frameworks, the Canadian Code of Ethics for Psychologists (Canadian Psychological Association, 2017) and ethics model made from a multicultural perspective (Frame & Williams, 2005).

Although the Canadian Code of Ethics (Code) was created by psychologists, it can be applied by a broader audience. The model is based on these four principles, ranked from highest to lowest weight:

1. Respect for the Dignity of Persons and Peoples
2. Responsible Caring
3. Integrity in Relationships
4. Responsibility to Society

Canadian Psychological Association (2017) also gives 10 steps to approach an ethical decision-making process.

The multicultural model is created for counsellors, but just like the Canadian Code applicable in a broader sense. It also gives steps to approach the decision-making process and gives practical examples of situations where considering cultural differences are important. The basis of the multicultural model is built on the universalist philosophy recognizing cultural differences. Universalists try to find fundamental similarities that link cultural context, even though it manifests itself differently.

The Canadian Code does mention the cultural aspect, but it is more integrated in the first and second principle. The multicultural model emphasizes that cultural background and one's (power) positions within this culture of both the client and the counsellor should be assessed.

When considering ethics as part of a data science project, I think both models would cover the important points of evaluating who is involved and influenced by a decision, what the long-terms risks and benefits are, considering all options and alternative ones, and finally evaluate the outcome. But as artificial intelligence in general requires knowledge and compute, it often can become expensive projects performed by skilled educated people. Not everywhere in the world this is possible, while the results of those projects might be used in those places. For examples, algorithms that decide who gets to see which commercials on social media might be designed by big tech companies like Google or Meta, they affect people all over the world.

I think that the multicultural model is better suited for data science project as it focusses both on the context of the developer and the end user.
